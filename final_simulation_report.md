- `DOMContentLoaded` events: 6 added, 0 removed (6 potential leaks)
- `message` events: 5 added, 2 removed (3 potential leaks)
- `load` events: 5 added, 0 removed (5 potential leaks)
- Network events (`online`/`offline`): 6 added, 0 removed (6 potential leaks)

**Timer Leaks** ❌
- `setTimeout` calls: 75 instances, only 6 cleared
- **69 unmatched timers** could cause memory accumulation over time

**DOM Reference Overhead** ⚠️
- 513 total DOM selectors (481 getElementById, 32 others)
- High DOM selector usage without reference caching

### 2. 🎤 Voice System Edge Cases

**Issues Identified**:
- ❌ Voice recognition without proper cleanup detected
- Missing `recognition.stop()` or `recognition.abort()` calls
- Potential microphone resource leaks

**Recommendations**:
- Implement proper voice recognition lifecycle management
- Add cleanup functions for speech recognition instances

### 3. 🌐 Network & Offline Handling

**Strengths** ✅:
- Proper network status detection implemented
- Service Worker with comprehensive caching
- Fetch operations with error handling

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Need unhandled promise rejection listeners
- Enhanced offline degradation strategies

### 4. 💾 Storage Management

**Performance** ✅:
- 116 localStorage operations with error handling
- IndexedDB implementation with proper error handling
- Cache API functionality working correctly

**Edge Cases Covered**:
- Storage quota exceeded scenarios
- Corrupted data handling
- Large data storage/retrieval

### 5. 🏃‍♂️ Performance Under Stress

**Current Performance**:
- DOM manipulation: 133 operations detected
- JSON parsing: Efficient for data structures up to 1000 items
- Event handling: Good performance for up to 1000 events

**Stress Test Results**:
- ✅ Large array creation (1M items): Handled successfully
- ✅ Rapid object creation (10K objects): No critical failures
- ⚠️ Memory usage monitoring needed for long sessions

## 🚨 UX-Breaking Scenarios Identified

### Scenario 1: Memory Exhaustion
**Trigger**: Extended use with voice commands and geolocation
**Impact**: Browser becomes unresponsive, app crashes
**Probability**: High for sessions > 2 hours

### Scenario 2: Voice Recognition Lockup
**Trigger**: Rapid speech recognition starts without cleanup
**Impact**: Microphone becomes unavailable, requires browser restart
**Probability**: Medium with power users

### Scenario 3: Event Listener Cascade Failure
**Trigger**: Multiple component initializations without cleanup
**Impact**: Degraded performance, unresponsive UI elements
**Probability**: High in complex workflows

### Scenario 4: Storage Quota Silent Failure
**Trigger**: Heavy data logging reaching browser limits
**Impact**: Data loss without user notification
**Probability**: Medium for intensive usage
